This package contains source, object, binary and documentation for
OS/2 versions of 39 common *IX command line utilities.
 
AIXLIKE INFBIN is the OS/2 on-line documentation
 
AIXLIKE SCRIPT is marked up documentation for each of the commands.
 
AIXLBIN ZIPBIN contains executables for the commands.  Download
as a binary file, then use Info-Zip's unzip to unpack it into a
subdirectory.

AIXLSRC ZIPBIN contains source and make files for the commands.
 
AIXLUTL ZIPBIN contains source and make files for common routines
shared by two or more of the commands.
 
You can unzip AIXLBIN ZIPBIN into its own directory or any other
directory in your PATH using Info-Zip's unzip.  Info-Zip is available
on OS2TOOLS in the INFOZIP2 PACKAGE.  If you do not specify
the -j flag, unzip will put the files in a .\bin subdirectory off the
current directory.
 
A good way to unpack the SRCBIN and UTLBIN files is to
 
            - create a subdirectory (say, AIXLIKE),
            - cd to it,
            - receive the zip files there,
            - unpack with "unzip aixlsrc.zip" and "unzip aixlutl.zip"
 
The contents of these files are:
 
     util -  contains 7 subdirectories, each of which contains
             source and object for a routine common to one or
             more of the utilities:
                 fmf - routines to walk a directory tree
                 getopt - a command line parser
                 greputil - regular expression compilation and matching
                 myerror - an error routine.
                 isvalnam - returns TRUE if arg is a valid object name
                            for the file system in use.
                 makepath - creates a path.
                 sleep - unixlike sleep function
     src  -  contains a bunch of subdirectories, each of which contains
             source, .def file for one utility.

                 du - displays information about file system usage
                 fgrep - searches files for matching strings
                 find - searches name space for matching file objects
                 grep - searches files for strings matching a regular

                         implementations)
                 paste - glues columns together
                 printenv - writes environment information to stdout
                 ps - lists running processes
                 pwd - writes the name of the current working directory
                         to stdout
                 rm    - deletes files
                 sed   - a stream editor
                 sleep - suspends processing for a time interval

                 wc    - counts lines, words and characters in files
                 what  - finds and prints SCCS keywords in files
                 which - shows which command will be executed
                 xx - xxencode and xxdecode, which are VNET-friendly
                      alternatives to uuencode and uudecode
